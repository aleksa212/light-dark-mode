This project is created for practice purposes. The user can switch from light mode to dark mode by toggling a button. After clicking on a button, every DOM element is going to change color. The user can also click on navigation bar which will smooth scroll to desired section on the page.

This project helped me practice working with localStorage and manipulating styles.
